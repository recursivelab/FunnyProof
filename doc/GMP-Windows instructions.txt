Build instructions for using GMP on windows.

1. Download Qt for Windows 32-bit MinGW.

2. Run installer as administrator and install Qt for all users with all
   available packages possibly without source code as only exception.

3. Download MinGW (not MinGW-w64) installer and run it as administrator and
   install it following next instructions.

4. Update catalogue.

5. Select all packages for instalation.

6. Select all packages for update.

7. Apply it.

8. Repeat steps 4-7 until any new package or update exists.

9. Download the latest version of GMP and unpack it for example in directory
   C:\Downloads\gmp.

10. Go to MinGW instalation directory then msys subdirectory, then 1.0
    subdirectory and run msys.bat to open msys console.

    We assume that instalation directory of MinGW is C:\MinGW and that gmp is
unpacked to directory C:\Downloads\gmp. The last is path of configure file.

11. In msys console type following comand lines:

cd /C/Download/gmp
./configure CC=/C/MinGW/bin/mingw32-gcc
make
make check

    If no errors reported, a contents of directory C:\Downloads\gmp\.libs copy
to the directory like C:\Qt\Qt5.6.0\5.6\mingw49_32\lib and *.h files from
directory C:\Downloads\gmp to the directory like
C:\Qt\Qt5.6.0\5.6\mingw49_32\include.

Exact paths depending on Qt installation directory and installed version.

To use it in Qt projects include headers like

#include <gmp.h>

where is needed amd add in *.pro file the lines

LIBS += -lgmp
